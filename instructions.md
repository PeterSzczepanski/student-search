# Full Stack Developer Candidate Test Assignment

The goal of the assignment is to create a back-end web service and a user interface for searching a database. The details of the project are as follows:

We need an application that will allow us to search for students by their name (first, last, or both). 

The search results should return the following fields:
* First Name
* Last Name
* Average Grade (GPA)

From the student search, the user should be able to acquire more information about the student via a details view. The details should include the following fields:
* First Name
* Last Name
* Email Address
* Average Grade (GPA)
* A list of classes that the student is attending along with the grade that the student has in each of the classes.

The front end of the app should be coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The back end of the application should be coded using a JVM based language/Python/Ruby/Node. The back-end should return JSON.

A sample data file in JSON is attached students_classes.json to give you a head start.

Please take the time to design and develop the project and use any tools available to you (developer forums, Google, Eclipse, W3C, etc...). Please feel free to use any code that youâ€™ve used in the past. The application should be functional when it is submitted.

You should complete the assignment and submit results within 1 week. Put it on github. We should be able to clone the repo and run the app easily.
